This project will in general adhere to the google style guide for c++ (URL: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with the following notable exceptions:

Files will be named with a .cpp extension
Types/class/structs/functions are named in lowercase with underscores to separate words
Variables are named using camel case.

Notably, the directory structure should usually match the namespace structure. The project is named dynsolver. If a class is defined in the path src/path/to/file.cpp it should reside in the namespace dynsolver::path::to.

Tests are kept in a directory structure that matches the source directory but, has root as test. That is, the tests for the class src/path/to/file.cpp will reside in the test/path/to/file_test.cpp and will exist in the namespace dynsolver::path::to::test. Since it is a child of the namespace that file.cpp the tests can access the tested class without extra qualifications. We use the Catch testing framework which is contained entirely in the header file located at test/catch.hpp.
