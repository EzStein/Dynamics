This project consists of several mini libraries which may be installed onto
your system. Each library contains public and private headers. Assuming that
the library is named "lib_name" it will have the directory structure:
dynsolver
--lib_name
----CMakeLists.txt
----src
------CPP FILES
------include
--------PRIVATE HEADER FILES
----include
------lib_name
--------PUBLIC HEADER FILES
----test

All symbols in the library live in a namespace named after that library.
Once installed, public header files may be accessed through <lib_name/header_name.h>
Each library can be compiled and installed independently using its CMakeLists.txt.
