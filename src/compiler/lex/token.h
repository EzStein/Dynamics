/*These tokens are used during operator precedence parsing as indexes to an array. Only tokens that
are actual terminals are needed to index the array. Use TOKEN_COUNT as the array size.
The array is organized as follows. Each pair of tokens gets 2bits in an unsigned char * array
of size TOKEN_COUNT*CHUNK_SIZE where Chunk_Size is 1 + (TOKEN_COUNT - 1)/4 Assuming chars are 8 bits.
We index a chunk using the first TOKEN_COUNT and the the 2bit are of the CHUNK is indexed by the second token count.
Thus we have (array[TK1 * CHUNK_SIZE + TK2/4] & (0xC0u >> 2*(TK2%4))) >> 2*(TK2%4)  which gives the value of the token. If this value
is 0 we say TK1 < TK2. If 1, TK1 = TK2, and 2, TK1 > TK2*/
