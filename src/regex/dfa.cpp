  // Powerset Construction Algorithm: The algorithm works as follows. The states
  // of the DFA are sets of states of the NFA. We start with the state containing
  // the NFA starting state. We use the epsilon closure and transition function
  // to find all states reacheable over a given transition character. If we have
  // never seen this set of states before, we add a state to the dfa graph vector
  // and add a transition from the original state to the newly added one, of the
  // appropriate character. We do this for all characters. We then repeate the
  // process for all newly created states. The DFA accepting states are any
  // states that contain an NFA accepting state.
  //
  // We maintain both a stack and a map. The stack is a collection of
  // std::set<int> (a set of NFA states) that have yet to be processed.
  // It is initialized to contain the std::set containing just
  // the epsilon closure of the NFA start. While
  // the stack is nonempty, we pop an element off the stack. Using this element,
  // we add potentially kNumberOfCharacters
  // more elements (one corresponding to the set of
  // states reacheable through a given character transition). For each of the
  // kNumberOfCharacters added elements,
  // we lookup the index of the corresponding DFA state in
  // the map. If it does not already exist, we generate a DFA state and add the
  // set associated with it to the map. Finally, we add transitions from the
  // DFA state associated with the popped set to each of the
  // kNumberOfCharacters states
  // associated with the newly pushed sets. If the DFA state associated to the
  // popped set is accepting if the popped set contains an NFA accepting state.
  // Note that it is possible that one of the newly pushed sets will already
  // be in the stack, or will have already been processed by the stack. Thus
  // we associated to each set (using the same map as the index association)
  // a visited bool which is set to true once the set is processed by the stack.
  //
  // The map associates a std::set<int> representing a set of nfa states
  // to a set_info struct which exists in an anonymous namespace. The struct
  // has an index field storing the dfa state associated to it, and a
  // visited bool indicating whether the set has already been processed or not.
  //
  // Note that in order to prevent unnecessary redundent storage and copying,
  // the stack will actually contain iterators that point to key-value pairs
  // in the setInfoMap. The actual set objects will be stored in the map,
  // and the stack will simply contain references to them. Note that this
  // is a minor point and does not effect the algorithm.
  //
  // In Hopcroft's algorithm which follows we will need the inverse of
  // the graph variable. That is we will construct alongside graph,
  // graphInverse which maps state and character pairs to a list
  // of states which transition to the given one on the given character

  //
  // Hopcroft's Algorithm: The algorithm functions by partitioning the set of
  // states into classes whose behavior is the same under simulation of all
  // strings. Each state in one class behaves the same as another
  // state in the same class in the sense that for all strings,
  // the simulation of the DFA starting in both states ends in
  // accepting states or rejecting states but not both.
  // We start with a partition of the states into two classes
  // which are certainly have different behavior, the accepting and the
  // rejecting states. We then refine the partition P as follows: choose
  // a class (an element), C, of the partition P
  // and form the pre-image of C
  // on a given transition character, c.
  // That is, we find the set of states for
  // which there exists a transition on c to an element of C.
  // We call C the splitter set and we call its pre-image D.
  // Each element in D
  // necessarily behaves differently than an element in D's complement
  // since on the character transition c, an element in D transitions
  // to an element in C which behaves differently than any other element.
  // Thus we can now split each of the classs in the partition P according
  // to D. For each class, B in the partition P, we split it into
  // B intersect D and B - D. For a given splitter C we do this process for
  // each character. Once we have exhausted all the characters, we choose
  // a new splitter and do the process again.
  // It can be shown that this process eventually terminates in a partition
  // representing a minimal DFA.
  // The algorithm is not quite complete. The choice of C the splitter is
  // somewhay important. We choose C from a subset of the partition P which
  // we shall call L. L must always be a subset of P. It is produced as follows.
  // When we choose C from L, we remove C from L. Whenever we split a class
  // B in P, we choose one of the two splits B' or B'' to add to L. However,
  // if L already contains B, then we add both of them (and remove B from L).
  // The algorithm terminates when there are no more splitters to choose from L.
  // That is, when L is empty.
  //
  // An efficient implementation of this algorithm is somewhat complicated.
  // The following implementation is based on the proposed implementation
  // in the article "Around Hopcroft's Algorithm" by Manuel Baclet and
  // Claire Pagetti. Note that my version deviates slightly from the proposed
  // implementation most notably in the numbering of indices as
  // half-open intervals in the partition array.
  // In this implementation, each class of the partition is assigned an index.
  // We need the following data structures:
  //
  // graphInverse - This is a std::vector<std::list<int> >[] that maps each
  //                DFA state and character pair to a list of states that 
  //                transition to it over that character. In particular,
  //                graphInverse[character][state] contains  implies that
  //                graph[val].transition[character] == state
  //
  // partition - A fixed size array of ints refering to all the states of the
  //             DFA. The ints are constantly permuted in the array so as to
  //             be consistent with the next data structure.
  //
  // partitionInverse - A fixed size array which is the inverse of the partition
  //                    array. That is, if partition[a] = b then
  //                    partitionInverse[b] = a
  //
  // classIndices - A std::vector of index_pair. The indices of this std::vector
  //                are the classes of the partition. The elements of the class
  //                with indexPair (low, high) are the elements of partition with
  //                indices between low (inclusive) and high (exclusive).
  //
  // classSplitPointer - This is a std::vector of ints which maps the classes
  //                     to an index, i, in the partition array. If l and h
  //                     denote the bounds of the class in the partition array,
  //                     l (inclusive) to i (exclusive) denote the part of the
  //                     class that (definitely)
  //                     has elements in common with the pre-image of the splitter.
  //                     Likewsie, i (inclusive) to h (exclusive) indicate the
  //                     other split of the class. Note that this variable
  //                     is used for intermediate results, is updated as we
  //                     iterate through the pre-image of the splitter.
  //
  // classArray - A fixed size array of ints that map each state of the DFA to
  //              its class (that is, to its index in classIndices).
  //
  // splitters - A stack of ints refering to classes in P. This stack is used
  //             to select the next splitter which will always be the one most
  //             recently added.
  //
  // visitedClasses - A std::vector of ints which holds the classes that we
  //                  may need to split (the classes with a nonempty intersection
  //                  with the pre-image of the splitter).
  // 
  // splitterIntersection
  //             - A std::vector which holds the elements of splitter which
  //             are in common with the pre-image of splitter. This is necessary
  //             since we are iterating over the elements of splitter and thus
  //             cannot modify it immediately.
  //
  // We start with a partition of two classes, the accepting and rejecting
  // states. While splitters is not empty, we pop splitters into splitter
  // and for each character we do the following:
  // We permute the elements of each class
  // so that the left side of the class contains elements in common with
  // the pre-image of the splitter. We update the classSplitPointer
  // accordingly. We accomplish this as follows:
  // We iterate through the pre-image of splitter.
  // On each DFA state in the iteration, we identify which class it is in.
  // This indicates that the class has a nonempty intersection with the
  // pre-image. We then swap that element with the element pointed to
  // by the classSplitPointer array and we increment this pointer.
  // After iterating through all elements, the pointer will indicate where
  // the split of the class would occur. Note however that since we are
  // iterating over the splitter, we cannot simply swap elements in the
  // splitter (it would screw up the iteration order). Instead we store those
  // elements of the splitter witch are in common to the splitter's pre-image
  // in splitterIntersection. Once the iteration is complete, we process the
  // splitter class just like the otherse using the splitterIntersection info.
  // We now have permuted the elements of each class so that they are ready
  // to be split. As an optimization, we do not need to split classes which
  // we did not actually permute, so we maintain a visitedClasses variable which
  // contains the classes which potentially need to be split. Classes of one element
  // cannot be split so are also ommitted from visitedClasses.
  //
  // We can now perform the partition refinement. For each class in visitedClasses
  // we check to see if the class needs to be split. It only needs to be split
  // if the classSplitPointer does not point to either the high or low endpoint
  // of the class. After checking this condition, we compute which of the two
  // class sections is smaller. We add a new class to the stack and to the
  // classIndices array whose indices are indicate the smaller section. We
  // also update the old class's indices to reflect those of the longer section.
  // We must also reset the classSplitPointer array of the changed classes
  // to the lower endpoint index.
  //
  // Running this algorithm on all character/splitter pairs until the
  // splitter stack is empty produces a partition of the old DFA where
  // all transitions on a given character from an element of a class
  // go to (potentiall different) elements of a single (possibly different) class.
  // We can recover the new optimized DFA by assigning a state to each class
  // and a transition from class to class according to how its elements
  // transition.
