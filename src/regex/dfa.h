// deterministic finite automata. Whereas the NFA implementation generally
// requires less space then the DFA implementation, simulating an NFA is far
// slower than simulating a DFA. If you want a fast regex evaluation at the
// expensive of a larger memory cost, use a DFA.
//
// This class is optimized for speed. It is implemented using a std::vector
// whose elements are states. Each state contains a fixed kMaxCharacterValue+1
// element array. That is it can hold items indexed from 0 to kMaxCharacterValue
// inclusive. It is an array
// of ints representing the transition from that state on each character.
// Each state also contains a bool value indicating whether it is an accepting
// state or not. DFA's do not have epsilon transitions.
//
// Class invariant: All DFA objects are minimal. That is, upon construction,
// this class will attempt to minimize itself.

  // We ignore characters whose indices are less than startPosition.

  // finding the longest matched prefix of
  // candidate.substr(startPosition, candidate.size() - startPosition).
  // By default startPosition is 0 indicating that the whole string should
  // be considered. The startPosition value may be anywhere from 0 to
  // candidate.length() inclusive. If it is candidate.length(), then
  // we consider the empty string. If startPosition is out of range then
  // the behavior is undefined (we may assert an error in development mode).
  // 
  // The matched prefix if it exists can be recovered
  // using candidate.substr(startPosition, length) where
  // length is the returned integer. In particular the substring
  // spans from character startPosition (inclusive)
  // to character length (exclusive).
  // Note that if the empty string is the longest matched prefix,
  // this function returns 0. If the pattern does not match any prefix
  // (not even the empty string) then the value -1 is returned.
