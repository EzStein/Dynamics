// for tokenization are set at construction and cannot be changed afterwords.
// In order to hide the implementation of the lexer's rules, we use a builder
// class which allows us to generate a lexer object which can not be mutated.
// The lexer_builder class allows us to register an arbitrary number of rules.
// The rules are string, integer pairs. The string is a regular expression
// and the integer is the rule identifier (one may think of this as the token
// associated to the regular expression). When all the desired rules are
// registered, a lexer object may be created. Note that the order in which rules
// are registered is important. If the lexer can match more than one rule/token
// to a lexeme, then the first rule registered is given precedence. The
// associated id (token) is returned.
